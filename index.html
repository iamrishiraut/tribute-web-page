        <h2>The man of the masses</h2>
        <p>Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s history as the Prime Minister of India is also quite remarkable. He served as the country’s Prime Minister for three terms. In the year 1996, he was sworn in as the 10th Prime Minister of India. However, when the Bharatiya Janata Party failed to form a majority in the Lok Sabha, Vajpayee resigned just after a period of 16 days as it became evident that he did not have the support necessary to form a government. His second term as a Prime Minister began after the 1998 general elections that resulted in the formation of the National Democratic Alliance. This Atal Bihari Vajpayee led government lasted for a total of 13 months. The third and final term of Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s lasted for the full 5-year period starting from 1999 to 2004. Since Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the only candidate to have become Prime Minister of India with 2 successive mandates.</p>
